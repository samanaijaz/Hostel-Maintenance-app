# Hostel Complaint Management App

The Hostel Complaint Management App is a Flutter-based application designed to streamline and manage hostel-related complaints at IIT Jodhpur. The app provides an efficient way for students to register complaints regarding various issues in the hostel, such as maintenance, facilities, cleanliness, and more. The registered complaints are automatically forwarded to the respective caretakers via SMS. Once the issues are resolved, the caretakers mark the complaints as resolved, and they are removed from the portal.

This README file provides an overview of the project, its features, installation instructions, and usage guidelines.

## Features

- **Complaint Registration:** Students can submit complaints by providing details such as the type of issue, location, description, and images (if necessary).

- **SMS Notification:** Once a complaint is registered, an SMS notification is automatically sent to the responsible caretaker, providing them with all the necessary complaint details.
